        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="TextParagraph">
                    Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore Inland Lake,
                    just a small commute from major centers in the south west. 
                    Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the South West damn.
                    From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake.
                    Due to the warm climate that extends year-round, Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the south west.
                    Boat owners from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area. 

            <br /><br />
                    Inland Marina has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length. 
                    Dock services include electrical and fresh water.
                </p>
